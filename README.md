# KI-Tools Testing

Welcome to the **KI-Tools Testing** repository. This repository is designed to explore the development of software components both with and without the assistance of Artificial Intelligence (AI). Each component—be it a class or a function—is to be implemented twice: once manually (without AI) and once using AI technologies. This is to compare the efficiency, effectiveness, and differences in implementation strategies between traditional and AI-assisted development.

## Repository Structure

The repository contains two main project directories, each with subdirectories for AI and non-AI implementations:

## Development Guidelines

When developing:

- Implement each component (classes and functions) in both withoutAI and withAI directories within the appropriate project folder.
- Measure and document the time taken for each implementation.
- Ensure all unit tests pass to validate the functionality of each component.
